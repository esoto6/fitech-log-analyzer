Term,Definition
EFI,Electronic Fuel Injection — a system that uses electronic controls to inject fuel directly into the engine's intake manifold or cylinders.
ECU,"Engine Control Unit — the computer that controls EFI, adjusting fuel delivery, ignition timing, and other parameters."
MAP Sensor,Manifold Absolute Pressure sensor — measures the pressure in the intake manifold for calculating air density.
MAF Sensor,Mass Air Flow sensor — measures the amount of air entering the engine.
TPS,Throttle Position Sensor — detects the angle of the throttle plate.
O2 Sensor,Oxygen sensor — measures oxygen levels in the exhaust to adjust fuel mixture.
Fuel Rail,A pipe that delivers pressurized fuel to the injectors.
Fuel Injector,A nozzle that sprays fuel into the intake air stream or directly into the cylinder.
IAC Valve,Idle Air Control valve — regulates airflow into the engine at idle.
Fuel Pressure Regulator,Maintains consistent fuel pressure in the fuel rail.
Coolant Temperature Sensor,Monitors engine coolant temperature for ECU adjustments.
Knock Sensor,Detects engine knock (pinging) to allow ECU to adjust timing.
Crankshaft Position Sensor,Monitors the position and rotational speed of the crankshaft.
Camshaft Position Sensor,Monitors the position and speed of the camshaft.
AFR,Air-Fuel Ratio — the ratio of air to fuel in the combustion mixture.
Open Loop,EFI mode where the ECU ignores O2 sensor feedback and runs from preset maps.
Closed Loop,EFI mode where the ECU uses O2 sensor feedback to fine-tune the mixture.
Fuel Map,A programmed table in the ECU that determines fuel delivery based on sensor inputs.
Rev Limiter,Prevents the engine from exceeding a certain RPM.
Wideband O2 Sensor,More accurate oxygen sensor for tuning EFI systems.
